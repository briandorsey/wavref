|| where N = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . |

The recommended block size for coding is 256 * <channels> bytes* min(1, (<samples_per_second>/ 11 kHz))  Smaller values cause the block header to become a more significant storage overhead. But, it is up to the implementation of the coding portion of the algorithm to decide the optimal value for <block_align> within the given constraints (see above). The decoding portion of the algorithm must be able to handle any valid block size. Playback software needs to process a multiple of <block_align> bytes of data at a time, so the value of <block_align> can be used for allocating buffers."

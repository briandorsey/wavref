# WAV Metadata

TODO: 

## Software

Many applications can read/write WAV audio, but relatively few process metadata chunks. Here are some applications which engage deeply with metadata: 

* [Soundminer](https://info.soundminer.com/docs/about-metadata) (paid) - Audio asset manager. "...create files that are compatible with BWAV Bext, iXML, Adobe XMP and id3 systems"
* [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) (open source) - "...convenient unified display of the most relevant technical and tag data for video and audio files"
* [jhove](https://jhove.openpreservation.org/modules/wave/) (open source) - "...file format identification, validation & characterisation"

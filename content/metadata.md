# WAV Metadata

TODO: 

## Software

Many applications can read/write WAV audio, but comparatively fewer process the various chunks containing metadata. Here are some applications which engage deeply with metadata: 

* [Soundminer](https://info.soundminer.com/docs/about-metadata) - (paid) - Audio asset manager. "...embed their files, not only with Soundminer's noted metawrapper, but to create files that are compatible with BWAV Bext, iXML, Adobe XMP and id3 systems"
* [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) - "convenient unified display of the most relevant technical and tag data for video and audio files"
* [jhove](https://jhove.openpreservation.org/modules/wave/) - "Open source file format identification, validation & characterisation"

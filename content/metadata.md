# WAV Metadata

TODO: 

## Software

Many applications can read/write WAV audio, but relatively few process metadata chunks. Here are some applications which engage deeply with metadata: 

* [Soundminer](https://info.soundminer.com/docs/about-metadata) (paid) - Audio asset manager. "...create files that are compatible with BWAV Bext, iXML, Adobe XMP and id3 systems"
* [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) (open source) - "...convenient unified display of the most relevant technical and tag data for video and audio files"
* [jhove](https://jhove.openpreservation.org/modules/wave/) (open source) - "...file format identification, validation & characterisation"
* [wavinfo](https://wavinfo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (open source) - "The wavinfo package allows you to probe WAVE and RF64/WAVE files and extract extended metadata. wavinfo has an emphasis on film, video and professional music production but aspires to be the encyclopedic and final source for all WAVE file metadata." Command line and Python module.

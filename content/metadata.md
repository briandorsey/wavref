# WAV Metadata

TODO: 

## Software

Many applications can read/write WAV audio, but relatively few process metadata chunks. Here are some applications which engage deeply with metadata: 

* [wavrw](https://github.com/briandorsey/wavrw/) (open source) - "command line tool to read and write WAV files with a focus on visualizing the structure of files and parsing metadata." Command line application and Rust library. Sibling project to this book... trying to write wavrw inspired (required?) writing the book. :) Nearly everything listed in the book is supported by wavrw because I'm updating them together.
* [Soundminer](https://info.soundminer.com/docs/about-metadata) (paid) - Audio asset manager. "...create files that are compatible with BWAV Bext, iXML, Adobe XMP and id3 systems." Cross platform GUI application.
* [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) (open source) - "...convenient unified display of the most relevant technical and tag data for video and audio files." Crossplatform GUI and command line application.
* [jhove](https://jhove.openpreservation.org/modules/wave/) (open source) - "...file format identification, validation & characterisation." Crossplatform GUI and command line application.
* [wavinfo](https://wavinfo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (open source) - "The wavinfo package allows you to probe WAVE and RF64/WAVE files and extract extended metadata. wavinfo has an emphasis on film, video and professional music production but aspires to be the encyclopedic and final source for all WAVE file metadata." Command line applicationand Python module.

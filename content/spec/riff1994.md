RIFF1994
========

RIFF1994 is an update to {{ spec(ref="RIFF1991") }}. It documents general updates to the RIFF format, WAVE related updates:

* [inst] and [smpl] chunks.
* update [`fmt `](@/chunk/fmt.md) to document WAVEFORMATEX
* [`fmt `](@/chunk/fmt.md)`.format_tag` 0x0000 redefined to "for development purposes". UNKNOWN is now 0xFFFF.
* compare country codes and language and dialect code tables to current list
* many additional [`fmt `](@/chunk/fmt.md) chunk definitions for registered [`fmt `](@/chunk/fmt.md)`.format_tag`s.
* encoding/decoding algorithm descriptions for ADPCM, MPEG-1 audio

Most of the new [`fmt `](@/chunk/fmt.md) chunk definitions are for proprietary compressed formats from the early 90s. With a few exceptions (see [`fmt `](@/chunk/fact.md) for documented tags) I haven't documented them here, because I *think* they're extremely rare. If you're aware usage of a particlar `format_tag` that isn't already documented please let me know, and I'll add it to the book.

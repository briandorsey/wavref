ITU-R BS.2088-1
========

> This Recommendation contains the specification of the Broadcast Wave 64Bit (BW64) audio file format including the new chunks <`ds64`>, <`axml`>, <`bxml`>, <`sxml`> and <`chna`>, which enable the file to carry large multichannel files and metadata including the Audio Definition Model (ADM) specified in Recommendation ITU-R BS.2076.

While this document is about a new format, it is built on top of RIFF and includes relevant sections of {{ spec(ref="RIFF1991") }} in section "Annex 2": 

> The information in this Annex is taken from the specification documents of the RIFF file format. It
is included for information only. It is included due to the lack of a reliable external source for
referencing.

It provides an alternate source for information specified in {{ spec(ref="RIFF1991") }}.
